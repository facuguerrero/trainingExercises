# Fractional Knapsack Problem
The 0-1 knapsack problem is the following. A thief robbing a store finds n
items. The ith item is worth i dollars and weighs wi pounds, where i and wi are
integers. The thief wants to take as valuable a load as possible, but he can carry at
most W pounds in his knapsack, for some integer W . Which items should he take?
(We call this the 0-1 knapsack problem because for each item, the thief must either
take it or leave it behind; he cannot take a fractional amount of an item or take an
item more than once.)

In the fractional knapsack problem, the setup is the same, but the thief can take
fractions of items, rather than having to make a binary (0-1) choice for each item.
