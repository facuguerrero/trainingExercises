# Average Pair
Write a function called average_pair. Given a sorted array of integers and a target
average, determine if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of
the pair equals the target average. There may be more than one pair that matches
the average target. The time complexity of the solution should be inferior or equal to O(n).


### Example 1:
* Input: list = [1, 2, 3], average = 2.5
* Output: True

### Example 2:
* Input: list = [1, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 19], average = 8
* Output: True

### Example 3:
* Input: list = [-1, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6], average = 4.1
* Output: False

### Example 4:
* Input: list = [], average = 4.
* Output: False

### Analysis:
* Time Complexity: O(n)
